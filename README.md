##QOSF Cohort 9 Screening Task 2: Odd to Even

Design a quantum algorithm that when given numbers of range [1,n) and are odd convert them into even numbers, and they must stay in the same range so they cannot be less than 1 nor greater than n. n = 2^k where k is the number of qubits you are going to use.


Example:


B = odd_to_even (n = 31,list= [1,2,2,4,5,6,7,11,17,21,22,23] )
print(B)

One possible output is
 
“[2,2,2,4,4,6,8,10,18,20,22,22]”
